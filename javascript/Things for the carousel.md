# THINGS FOR THE CAROUSEL.
    - WE WANT THE IMAGES TO BE ALIGNED SIDE BY SIDE TO EACH OTHER.
    - WE WANT IT THAT WHEN WE CLICK ON THE RIGHT BUTTON, IT SHOULD GO TO THE NEXT IMAGE, TILL THE VERY END.
        - WHEN IT GETS TO THE END, IT SHOULDN'T START FROM THE BEGINNING, BUT THE RIGHT BUTTIN SHOULD DISAPPEAR.
    - SAME AS THE LEFT, AS WE GO BACKWARDS FROM THE LAST IMAGE, THE LEFT BUTTON SHOULD DISAPPEAR, WHEN WE GET TO THE BEGINNING OF THE SLIDESHOW (carousel).
